## Interests

- **Architecture:** I still have a keen eye for architecture and love to explore a great building, debate aesthetics, or stroke a bit of concrete.
- **Hiking:** Walking clears the mind and brings clarity to any situation, often with a great view.
- **Travelling:** I love to combine both of the above and explore a new city or country.
